INSTRUCTION: Classify the speaker's belief about whether credit market conditions affect or amplify economic activity. Return null for unrelated content.

    # Your Task

    Classify the speaker's belief about the financial accelerator or credit channel based on their quote. You must determine whether the speaker believes that credit market conditions significantly amplify economic shocks, directly affect economic activity, have little effect, or if no belief is expressed.

    # Classification Categories

    **STRONG**: The speaker indicates that credit market conditions SIGNIFICANTLY AMPLIFY economic shocks through feedback effects between financial conditions and real activity.

    **MODERATE**: The speaker indicates either (a) a QUALIFIED amplification mechanism, OR (b) a DIRECT EFFECT of credit conditions on real economic activity without explicit feedback.

    **WEAK**: The speaker indicates that credit market conditions have LITTLE or NO effect on economic activity, or that financial-real economy linkages are minimal.

    **NULL**: The speaker does NOT express a credit channel belief (this is the default).

    # Classification Process

    Follow this systematic process to classify the quote:

    ## Step 1: Check for Explicit Financial Accelerator/Credit Channel Mentions

    If the quotation explicitly mentions "financial accelerator," "credit channel," "credit transmission mechanism," or "balance sheet channel" and expresses a view about it, classify as follows:
    - "Financial accelerator is broken/minimal/insignificant" → WEAK
    - "Financial accelerator remains strong/powerful/significant" → STRONG
    - "Financial accelerator exists but is weaker than before" → MODERATE

    If there is an explicit mention with a clear view, proceed directly to classification. Otherwise, continue to Step 2.

    ## Step 2: Identify Required Components

    For a credit channel belief to be present, the quote must mention BOTH of these components:

    **CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS** (at least one of):
    - Credit availability, credit access, lending standards, credit conditions
    - Bank lending, loan growth, credit flows
    - Credit spreads, risk premia, borrowing costs
    - Financial conditions, financial stress, financial tightness/ease
    - Balance sheet strength/weakness, net worth, collateral values
    - Leverage, debt burdens, debt service
    - Credit constraints, credit frictions, borrowing constraints

    **REAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY** (at least one of):
    - Investment, business spending, capital expenditures
    - Consumption, consumer spending, household expenditures
    - GDP growth, output, economic activity
    - Employment, hiring decisions
    - Business formation, entrepreneurship
    - Asset prices affecting wealth effects
    - Real economy effects, economic momentum

    If BOTH components are NOT present, classify as NULL.

    ## Step 3: Identify Causal Connection

    If both components are present, determine whether the speaker connects them causally. Simply mentioning both concepts without linking them is NOT sufficient for classification.

    **Signs of NO causal connection** (classify as NULL):
    - Only describes data without interpreting the relationship
    - Discusses policy responses without explaining the transmission mechanism
    - Provides historical narrative without making causal claims
    - Mentions both concepts in separate contexts without connecting them

    **Signs of causal connection** (proceed to Step 4):
    - Uses causal language linking credit conditions to real activity
    - Expresses concern or confidence about transmission from one to the other
    - Explains a mechanism by which one affects the other
    - Shows surprise at presence or absence of expected relationship

    ## Step 4: Classify the Type of Credit-Activity Relationship

    If a causal connection exists, determine what type of relationship the speaker describes:

    ### TYPE A — Amplification/Feedback

    The speaker describes credit conditions AMPLIFYING shocks through feedback mechanisms.

    **Indicators:**
    - Feedback language: "self-reinforcing," "spiral," "vicious/virtuous cycle," "feedback loop"
    - Amplification language: "magnify," "amplify," "exacerbate," "deepen," "compound," "worsen"
    - Explicit causal chains that close the loop: "tighter credit → weaker activity → tighter credit"
    - Propagation language: "spillover," "contagion," "cascade"

    **If Type A identified:** Proceed to Step 5 to classify strength.

    ### TYPE B — Direct Credit Effects

    The speaker describes credit conditions CAUSING changes in real activity, without explicit feedback or amplification language.

    **Indicators:**
    - Credit conditions affecting spending, investment, or growth
    - Balance sheet constraints limiting economic activity
    - Lending standards impacting borrowing and spending decisions
    - Financial stress weighing on the economy

    **Examples:**
    - "Tighter credit is slowing investment"
    - "Weak balance sheets are restraining consumption"
    - "Credit availability is affecting business spending"
    - "Lending standards are holding back housing"
    - "If net worth declines, consumers won't be able to maintain spending"
    - "Balance sheet repair will take years, restraining growth"

    **If Type B identified:** Classify as MODERATE.

    ### TYPE C — Denial of Credit Effects

    The speaker indicates credit conditions are NOT meaningfully affecting economic activity.

    **Indicators:**
    - Disconnection language: "despite tight credit," "credit hasn't constrained," "minimal impact"
    - Resilience emphasis: "strong balance sheets," "well-capitalized," "robust credit access"
    - Other factors dominate: "driven by fundamentals not credit," "not a credit problem"
    - Skepticism: "credit channel is weak," "limited transmission"

    **Examples:**
    - "Credit is not the constraint"
    - "Despite tight credit, investment has remained robust"
    - "Financial conditions haven't affected the real economy"
    - "Spillovers have not materialized"
    - "Firms have ample access to finance"

    **If Type C identified:** Classify as WEAK.

    ### NOT Credit Channel — Classify as NULL

    - Pure wealth effects without credit mechanism: "Lower asset prices reduce consumption through wealth effects"
    - Pure interest rate transmission without credit frictions: "Lower rates stimulate demand"
    - Monetary policy transmission without credit channel logic: "Easing will boost the economy"
    - Description of conditions without causal interpretation

    ## Step 5: Classify Amplification Strength (Type A Only)

    If the speaker describes amplification or feedback (Type A), classify the strength:

    ### STRONG Classification

    Use when the speaker indicates SIGNIFICANT amplification through feedback mechanisms, without hedging about the mechanism's strength.

    **Strong indicators:**
    - Unhedged amplification language: "magnifies," "amplifies," "multiplies," "reinforces"
    - Feedback/spiral language: "feedback loop," "self-reinforcing," "spiral," "cascade," "vicious cycle," "virtuous cycle"
    - Explicit closed-loop chains: "tighter credit → weaker balance sheets → tighter credit"
    - Historical validation: "as in 2008," "financial crisis showed"
    - Concern about compounding effects: "will feed on itself," "mutually reinforcing"

    **Examples:**
    - "Credit conditions are amplifying the downturn"
    - "We're seeing a self-reinforcing cycle of credit tightening and economic weakness"
    - "Balance sheet effects are creating powerful feedback mechanisms"
    - "The deterioration in financial conditions will magnify the impact on investment"
    - "Falling asset prices tighten credit, which further depresses asset prices"

    ### MODERATE Classification

    Use when the speaker describes amplification but with HEDGING about strength, scope, or certainty.

    **Strong indicators:**
    - Hedged amplification: "some amplification," "modest feedback," "may be reinforcing"
    - Partial scope: "amplifying effects for some borrowers," "feedback in certain sectors"
    - Weakening mechanism: "less amplification than past cycles," "muted feedback"
    - Conditional: "could amplify if conditions worsen," "risk of feedback effects"

    **Examples:**
    - "Credit conditions are creating some amplification, but effects are modest"
    - "The financial accelerator appears weaker than in past episodes"
    - "There may be some self-reinforcing dynamics, but they appear contained"
    - "Small businesses face amplifying credit constraints, though large firms have access"
    - "We see limited feedback effects between financial and real sectors"

    **Note on hedging language:** Classify based on the speaker's belief about the *mechanism's strength*, not their confidence about whether triggering conditions will materialize. "Credit conditions *could* amplify shocks significantly" is STRONG (believes in powerful mechanism, uncertain about trigger). "Credit conditions create *some* amplification" is MODERATE (believes mechanism is weak).

    ## Step 6: Handle Special Cases

    ### Forecasts and Projections
    Only classify if the reasoning reveals credit channel logic:
    - "I forecast slower growth" → NULL (no mechanism stated)
    - "I forecast slower growth because credit tightening will slow investment" → MODERATE (direct effect)
    - "I forecast slower growth because credit tightening will amplify the downturn" → STRONG (amplification)

    ### Historical References
    Only classify if the speaker endorses or rejects the credit-activity relationship:
    - "Credit was tight in 2008" → NULL (just description)
    - "Credit tightening slowed the economy in 2008" → MODERATE (endorses direct effect)
    - "The 2008 crisis showed how credit dynamics amplify shocks" → STRONG (endorses amplification)
    - "Unlike 2008, credit conditions aren't affecting this downturn" → WEAK (rejects relationship)

    ### Policy Discussions
    Only classify if the speaker explains the policy through credit channel logic:
    - "We should ease policy" → NULL (no mechanism)
    - "We should ease to support credit conditions and boost spending" → MODERATE (direct transmission)
    - "We should ease to prevent credit tightening from amplifying the downturn" → STRONG (amplification)

    ### Wealth Effects
    Wealth effects alone are NULL unless connected to credit mechanisms:
    - "Falling home prices will reduce consumption through wealth effects" → NULL (wealth effect only)
    - "Falling home prices will constrain home equity borrowing, reducing consumption" → MODERATE (credit mechanism)
    - "Falling home prices will tighten credit conditions, which will further depress home prices" → STRONG (feedback loop)

    ### Duration vs. Amplification
    Prolonged direct effects are MODERATE; only feedback loops are STRONG:
    - "Balance sheet repair will take years, restraining growth" → MODERATE (prolonged direct effect)
    - "Balance sheet problems will create a self-reinforcing cycle of weak growth and tight credit" → STRONG (feedback)

    # Classification Summary

    | Relationship Type | Description | Classification |
    |-------------------|-------------|----------------|
    | Amplification (unhedged) | Explicit feedback/spiral/amplify language | STRONG |

    - STRONG requires explicit amplification, feedback, or self-reinforcing language
    - MODERATE captures both hedged amplification AND direct credit effects without feedback language
    - WEAK captures denial or skepticism about credit-activity linkages
    - Pure wealth effects and pure interest rate transmission (without credit frictions) are NULL
    - Your reasoning must cite specific phrases from the quotation

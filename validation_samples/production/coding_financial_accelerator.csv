FA_0176,19108,"Alternatively, however, weak money and credit may primarily reflect balance sheet restructuring with minimal implications for aggregate demand, and the declines in interest rates may simply reflect market anticipation and then digestion of the policy easing combined with the belated recognition by bond holders that inflation is not likely to accelerate appreciably in the next few years.",Credit Markets,KOHN,1991-10-01,-1.0,weak
FA_0177,41137,"For example, our model may not fully incorporate the levels of debt held by both businesses and consumers and the implied fixed nominal payments associated with those commitments.

FA_0178,82250,"And I mention it because we've got this issue of daily liquidity being offered by mutual funds. They think that's going to be stressed again in this scenario. You're going to have a mismatch, and it's going to be apparent. You're going to have a widening of spreads. It's going to tighten conditions broadly, because these funds will sell what's liquid, and they won't be able to sell others.",Credit Markets,KAPLAN,2019-10-30,,null

FA_0182,53461,"Real GDP growth for the second quarter came in somewhat weaker than many expected, although I will note that as recently as April many people were expecting negative growth in the second quarter and it is now almost 2 percent.

FA_0183,37345,"Moreover, because markets are placing some weight on a 75 basis point move, a further 50 basis point reduction in the funds rate at this meeting is unlikely to boost the stock market, depreciate the dollar, or lower bond yields. With limited follow-through in financial markets from policy easing, as Dave has explained, economic growth remains below the growth of potential in the staff forecast and the unemployment rate rises rapidly.",Credit Markets,KOHN,2001-03-20,-1.0,weak

FA_0185,50879,"My sense is that, while we may see some marginal slowing in business investment, the effects are likely to be small because I don't think the marginal cost of funding for most businesses has gone up much and we aren't hearing reports of wholesale tightening of lending standards in the corporate sector.",Growth,LACKER,2007-09-18,-1.0,weak

FA_0187,19264,"As you described the economy, there were some fundamentals in terms of real estate and some adjustments in leverages and so forth that are going to be constraining.

FA_0192,48033,"However, the rise in asset prices and residential investment and the leverage caused by this long period of very expansionary monetary policy may lead to a process of adjustment in asset prices that could be more sustained and more damaging in terms of confidence and of demand than we expect. This risk is greater if we end up allowing more inflation than our forecast anticipates, for the required monetary policy response could induce an even sharper adjustment in risk premiums and asset prices.",Credit Markets,GEITHNER,2006-08-08,1.0,strong
